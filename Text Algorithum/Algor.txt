Goku moments after transforming into Super Saiyan Blue. This form is nearly identical to the first Super Saiyan form, the only differences being that the hair and irises are light blue in color and, in Goku's case, a single bang of his hair protruding upwards from the main lower bangs facing and curving forwards from either the left or right sides although this bang of hair does not always appear in some scenes. Super Saiyan Blue boasts a vibrant, fiery, electric blue aura, as opposed to the blazing orange aura from Super Saiyan God. The aura surrounding the Super Saiyan Blue form also appears to be glittering somewhat, with small sparkling particles of energy travelling upwards within the flames, with occasional surges of electricity. If one inspects closely, a very subtle yellow glow can be seen on the outside of the aura as well. It's unknown why this is present, but it could very well indicate traces of the original Super Saiyan aura mixed with the godly ki (as Goku stated to this form being the result of a Super Saiyan God-empowered user further transforming into a Super Saiyan), similar to the aura seen with Future Trunks' Super Saiyan Rage form, which too possesses an aura of two mixed colours.
